Project - Products Management
Key points
In this project we will work feature wise. That means we pick one object like user, book, blog, etc at a time. We work through it's feature. The steps would be:
We create it's model.
We build it's APIs.
We test these APIs.
We deploy these APIs.
We integrate these APIs with frontend.
We will repeat steps from Step 1 to Step 5 for each feature in this project.
This project is divided into 4 features namely User, Product, Cart and Order. You need to work on a single feature at a time. Once that is completed as per above mentioned steps. You will be instructed to move to next Feature.
In this project we are changing how we send token with a request. Instead of using a custom header key like x-api-key, you need to use Authorization header and send the JWT token as Bearer token.
Create a group database groupXDatabase. You can clean the db you previously used and resue that.
This time each group should have a single git branch. Coordinate amongst yourselves by ensuring every next person pulls the code last pushed by a team mate. You branch will be checked as part of the demo. Branch name should follow the naming convention project/productsManagementGroupX
Follow the naming conventions exactly as instructed.
